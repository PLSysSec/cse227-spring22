    **CSE 227: Graduate Computer Security**
         [*Deian Stefan*](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/)

About
==============================================================

This course focuses on computer security, exploring a range of topics – from
systems security, to web security, edge security, and privacy – to illustrate
some of the modern research challenges in the area and the standards for
advancement. It is not designed to be a tutorial course, but rather to give
students the context to understand current security research and evaluate their
interest in the field. The course will examine both the defensive and offensive
side of the field. At the conclusion of the course, the students will have the
foundation to conduct research in computer security and to apply the latest
security research to a particular area of practice.

Evaluation
==============================================================

Since the primary goal of this course is to prepare to you to do research, the
evaluation for this course is simple: (1) class participation and (2)
research project.

Participation (35%)
--------------------------------------------------------------

You are expected to read the assigned paper(s) before each meeting. In class we
will discuss the interesting parts of the paper(s). You are expected to do any
background reading on your own and come prepared with questions and an
evaluation of the paper. To make this easy: For each paper you will turn in a
short write-up morning of lecture (11am pacific).

Research project (65%)
--------------------------------------------------------------

You will work on projects in groups of 3-5.  The goal of the project is to
conduct original research in security. You are encouraged to come up with your
own project idea, but we have a few ideas that are well-scoped for a quarter
project.

At the end of the quarter, you are expected to turn in a short research paper
(6-10 pages) and give a 10 minute talk. We will have periodic status updates to
help you stay on track.
